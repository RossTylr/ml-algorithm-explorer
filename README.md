# ML Algorithm Explorer 

Welcome to the ML Algorithm Explorer! This repository is a personal educational project dedicated to exploring, understanding, and implementing various machine learning algorithms from scratch or using common libraries like Scikit-learn. Each algorithm is presented in a Jupyter Notebook with detailed explanations of its theory, implementation, and examples.

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to:
* Deepen understanding of core machine learning algorithms.
* Provide practical implementation examples.
* Serve as a learning resource and a quick reference.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

To run these notebooks locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/ml-algorithm-explorer.git
    cd ml-algorithm-explorer
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    * Using `venv`:
        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * Using `conda`:
        ```bash
        conda create -n ml_explorer python=3.9  # Or your preferred Python version
        conda activate ml_explorer
        ```
3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
2.  Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    # or
    jupyter lab
    ```
3.  Open any `.ipynb` file and start exploring!
